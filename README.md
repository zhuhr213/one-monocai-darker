# one-monocai-darker README

## Working with Markdown

A customized One-Monocai cross theme with a darker style, highlighting the packages, functions and variables, etc.
This theme version is typically inspired by * [One Dark Pro Monokai Darker Reloaded Theme](https://github.com/mxthevs/one-dark-pro-monokai-darker-reloaded) and * [One Monokai Dark Theme](https://github.com/tgreen7/vscode-one-monokai.git)


* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.
