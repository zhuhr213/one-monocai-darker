# one-monocai-darker README

## Working with Markdown

A customized One-Monokai cross theme with a darker style, highlighting the packages, functions and variables, etc.
This theme version is typically inspired by [One Dark Pro Monokai Darker Reloaded Theme](https://github.com/mxthevs/one-dark-pro-monokai-darker-reloaded) and [One Monokai Dark Theme](https://github.com/tgreen7/vscode-one-monokai.git)

**Enjoy!**
